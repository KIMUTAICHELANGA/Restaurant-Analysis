Restaurant Analysis Project Overview This project explores a dataset containing approximate information about restaurant chains worldwide. The primary aim is to conduct descriptive and statistical analyses to derive insights into various aspects of the restaurant industry.

Dataset The dataset, sourced from a public repository, includes details such as average cost for two, location, votes, aggregate rating, cuisines, country, rating text, etc. Data cleaning procedures were performed using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas to ensure data integrity.

Objectives The analysis aims to answer the following questions:

What is the total number of restaurants and cuisines worldwide? Which countries have the highest number of restaurants listed? Which cities offer the greatest number of "value for money" restaurants? What are the top 10 cuisines with the highest number of votes in a specific region? Which countries have restaurants offering online delivery? Which locality has the highest number of restaurants? Which restaurants offer good cuisine and maintain an average rating? Dashboard An interactive dashboard has been developed to visualize key insights derived from the analysis.

Conclusion The analysis provides valuable insights into various aspects of the restaurant industry, including costs, cuisine popularity, online delivery availability, and ratings. This information can be utilized by restaurant owners to make informed decisions and enhance their services.
